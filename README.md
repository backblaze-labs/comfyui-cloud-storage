# comfyui-cloud-storage

Cloud storage nodes for ComfyUI. Save images, video, and audio to any S3-compatible provider. Download and cache models from cloud storage. Works with Backblaze B2, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, and Google Cloud Storage.

> Upload generated content and manage AI models across machines using a single set of ComfyUI nodes and one `boto3` dependency.

## What Is comfyui-cloud-storage?

comfyui-cloud-storage is a custom node package for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) that adds cloud storage support to any workflow. It uses the S3-compatible API shared by all major object storage providers, so a single installation covers B2, S3, R2, and more. Configure your credentials once and wire the profile to any number of save, load, or browse nodes.

### Problem

ComfyUI stores everything on the local filesystem. Generated outputs pile up on one machine with no backup. Sharing models across machines means re-downloading multi-gigabyte files from HuggingFace on each one. There is no built-in way to upload results to cloud storage or distribute models from a central bucket.

### Solution

This package adds 10 nodes that plug directly into the ComfyUI graph. Save nodes upload generated images, video, and audio to your bucket. Load nodes pull images and audio back into the pipeline, and download and cache models locally with ETag-based invalidation and progress bars. Browse nodes list bucket contents, generate presigned sharing URLs, and verify your connection. All nodes use the same credential profile, resolved from environment variables or a JSON config file -- secrets never appear in workflow JSON.

### Who Should Use This

- ComfyUI users who want automated cloud backup of generated content
- Teams sharing a model library across multiple machines
- Anyone who wants to serve generated images via presigned URLs or CDN

## Key Features

- **Multi-provider** -- Built-in presets for Backblaze B2, AWS S3, Cloudflare R2, Wasabi, DigitalOcean Spaces, and GCS. Any S3-compatible endpoint works via the Custom provider.
- **Configure once** -- The Cloud Storage Profile node outputs a connection that wires to every other node. No repeated credential entry.
- **Save images, video, audio** -- Upload directly from the pipeline in PNG, JPG, WebP, MP4, WebM, FLAC, MP3, or WAV.
- **Download and cache models** -- Pull checkpoints, LoRAs, VAEs, and other model files from a bucket to the correct local `models/` directory. Skips re-download when the remote file hasn't changed (ETag comparison).
- **Browse and share** -- List bucket contents and generate time-limited presigned URLs from within a workflow.
- **Secure credentials** -- Resolved from environment variables or a server-side JSON file stored in ComfyUI's HTTP-inaccessible system directory. Never embedded in shareable workflows.
- **Progress tracking** -- Model downloads show a progress bar in the ComfyUI UI via `comfy.utils.ProgressBar`.
- **Lazy loading** -- `boto3` is only imported when a cloud storage node actually executes, so there's no startup penalty.

## Example workflows

The fastest way to learn this package is to drag one of the workflows in
[`examples/`](./examples/) into your ComfyUI canvas. Start with
`02_test_connection.json` to confirm your credentials work, then explore the
others. See [`examples/README.md`](./examples/README.md) for the full list.

## Quick Start

Prerequisites:

- ComfyUI installed and running
- Python >= 3.10
- A bucket on any S3-compatible provider (B2, S3, R2, etc.)
- Access key and secret key for that provider

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/backblaze-b2-samples/comfyui-cloud-storage
pip install -r comfyui-cloud-storage/requirements.txt
```

Set your credentials and restart ComfyUI:

```bash
export COMFY_S3_PROVIDER="Backblaze B2"
export COMFY_S3_ACCESS_KEY="your_key_id"
export COMFY_S3_SECRET_KEY="your_application_key"
export COMFY_S3_BUCKET="your-bucket-name"
export COMFY_S3_REGION="us-west-004"
```

The nodes appear under `cloud_storage/` in the node menu.

## Step-by-Step Setup

### 1. Install the Package

**Option A** -- Clone into custom_nodes:

```bash
cd ComfyUI/custom_nodes
git clone https://github.com/backblaze-b2-samples/comfyui-cloud-storage
pip install -r comfyui-cloud-storage/requirements.txt
```

**Option B** -- Symlink for development:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/backblaze-b2-samples/comfyui-cloud-storage ~/projects/comfyui-cloud-storage
ln -s ~/projects/comfyui-cloud-storage ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-cloud-storage
pip install boto3
```

### 2. Create a Bucket

Create a bucket with your provider. For Backblaze B2:

1. Log in to [B2 Cloud Storage](https://secure.backblaze.com/b2_buckets.htm)
2. Create a bucket (private is recommended)
3. Create an application key scoped to that bucket
4. Note the **keyID**, **applicationKey**, **bucket name**, and **endpoint** (e.g. `s3.us-west-004.backblazeb2.com`)

### 3. Configure Credentials

**Option A** -- Environment variables (simplest):

```bash
export COMFY_S3_PROVIDER="Backblaze B2"
export COMFY_S3_ACCESS_KEY="<keyID>"
export COMFY_S3_SECRET_KEY="<applicationKey>"
export COMFY_S3_BUCKET="<bucket-name>"
export COMFY_S3_REGION="us-west-004"
```

**Option B** -- Named profiles (multiple accounts or providers):

Create `ComfyUI/user/__cloud_storage/profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "b2-outputs": {
      "provider": "Backblaze B2",
      "access_key": "<keyID>",
      "secret_key": "<applicationKey>",
      "bucket": "my-comfyui-outputs",
      "region": "us-west-004"
    },
    "s3-models": {
      "provider": "AWS S3",
      "access_key": "<AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID>",
      "secret_key": "<AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY>",
      "bucket": "my-model-archive",
      "region": "us-east-1"
    }
  }
}
```

This file is stored in ComfyUI's system user directory (`__` prefix) and is not accessible via the HTTP API.

### 4. Use in a Workflow

1. Add a **Cloud Storage Profile** node (or skip it to use env vars)
2. Add a **Save Image to Cloud** node after your VAE Decode
3. Wire the profile output to the save node's profile input
4. Set your key prefix (e.g. `comfyui/images/2024-02/`)
5. Queue the prompt -- images upload to your bucket automatically

### 5. Verify

Check your bucket via the provider console or use the **List Bucket Contents** node to browse from within ComfyUI.

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Description | Default | Required |
|----------|-------------|---------|----------|
| `COMFY_S3_PROVIDER` | Provider name (see supported list below) | `AWS S3` | No |
| `COMFY_S3_ACCESS_KEY` | Access key / key ID | -- | Yes |
| `COMFY_S3_SECRET_KEY` | Secret key / application key | -- | Yes |
| `COMFY_S3_BUCKET` | Bucket name | -- | Yes |
| `COMFY_S3_REGION` | Region identifier | Provider default | No |
| `COMFY_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` | Custom endpoint URL (overrides provider preset) | -- | No |
| `COMFY_S3_ACCOUNT_ID` | Account ID (required for Cloudflare R2) | -- | R2 only |
| `COMFY_S3_PATH_PREFIX` | Default key prefix for all operations | -- | No |

### Supported Providers

| Provider | `COMFY_S3_PROVIDER` value | Default region | Notes |
|----------|--------------------------|----------------|-------|
| Backblaze B2 | `Backblaze B2` | `us-west-004` | Free 10 GB storage |
| AWS S3 | `AWS S3` | `us-east-1` | |
| Cloudflare R2 | `Cloudflare R2` | `auto` | Requires `COMFY_S3_ACCOUNT_ID` |
| Wasabi | `Wasabi` | `us-east-1` | |
| DigitalOcean Spaces | `DigitalOcean Spaces` | `nyc3` | |
| GCS (S3 interop) | `GCS (S3 interop)` | `auto` | Uses HMAC keys |
| Custom | `Custom` | -- | Set `COMFY_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` |

### Profile JSON

Stored at `ComfyUI/user/__cloud_storage/profiles.json`:

```json
{
  "profiles": {
    "<profile-name>": {
      "provider": "<provider name>",
      "access_key": "<key>",
      "secret_key": "<secret>",
      "bucket": "<bucket>",
      "region": "<region>",
      "endpoint_url": "<optional override>",
      "account_id": "<optional, for R2>",
      "path_prefix": "<optional default prefix>"
    }
  }
}
```

Credentials are resolved in order: environment variables -> named profile -> per-node widget overrides. Later layers override earlier ones. Widget overrides only apply to `bucket` and `path_prefix` -- credentials always come from env vars or the profile file.

### Filename templates

Save nodes accept these tokens in the `filename` widget:

| Token | Expands to | Example |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| `%batch_num%` | Batch index, starting at 0 | `ComfyUI_%batch_num%` -> `ComfyUI_0` |
| `%date%` | Local date `YYYY-MM-DD` | `out/%date%/img` -> `out/2026-04-28/img` |
| `%time%` | Local time `HHMMSS` | `clip_%time%` -> `clip_142233` |
| `%uuid%` | Random 8-char hex | `share_%uuid%` -> `share_8f3a2b71` |

### Read-only profiles

Add `"read_only": true` to a profile in `profiles.json` and save nodes will
refuse to upload through it. Useful for shared inference machines that should
download models but never write generated content. Load and browse nodes work
as normal.

### Object tagging

Add `"default_tags": {"key": "value", ...}` to a profile to apply S3 object
tags to every uploaded object. Tags are useful for cost allocation, lifecycle
policies, and search. Skipped automatically on Backblaze B2, which does not
implement the S3 PutObjectTagging API.

### Profile reload

Edits to `profiles.json` are picked up on ComfyUI server restart. The file is
read each time a node executes, so credential changes take effect on the next
queue run, but the **profile dropdown** in `Cloud Storage Profile` is built
when ComfyUI loads the schema, so newly added profiles will not appear until
you restart the server.

### Path prefix behavior

Every load/save/browse node prepends `path_prefix` (from the profile or
`COMFY_S3_PATH_PREFIX`) to its `key`/`key_prefix` argument. Leading slashes on
the user-supplied key are stripped before joining, so `/photo.png` and
`photo.png` produce the same final key. This keeps S3 object keys
clean and avoids accidental double slashes.

### Cache invalidation

`Load Image from Cloud` and `Load Audio from Cloud` issue a `HEAD` against the
remote object on each queue and use its `ETag` as ComfyUI's cache key. When the
remote file changes, the node re-runs; when it doesn't, ComfyUI reuses the
cached output. On transient network/auth failures the cache key falls back to a
deterministic input-derived sentinel, so a flaky network does not silently
freeze the cache or trigger redundant re-fetches.

`Download Model from Cloud` writes a sidecar `.s3etag` next to the cached file
and skips the download when the local ETag matches the remote one. Set
`force_redownload=True` to bypass the cache.

## Testing

```bash
pip install pytest boto3
cd comfyui-cloud-storage
python -m pytest tests/ -v
```

Tests mock boto3 and ComfyUI internals so they run standalone without a ComfyUI installation. The `test_user_agent.py` test spins up a local HTTP server to verify the `b2ai-comfyui` user agent string appears in actual HTTP requests.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Nodes don't appear in menu | Verify the package is in `custom_nodes/` and `boto3` is installed. Check ComfyUI startup logs for import errors. |
| "Cloud storage access key not configured" | Set `COMFY_S3_ACCESS_KEY` / `COMFY_S3_SECRET_KEY` env vars or create a profiles.json. |
| "Bucket not found" | Check the bucket name and region. For B2, the region is in the endpoint (e.g. `us-west-004`). |
| "Access denied" | Verify your key has read/write permissions on the bucket. For B2, check the application key's bucket scope. |
| Model download stalls | Check network connectivity. The download uses a temp file (`.download` suffix) and cleans up on failure. |
| "boto3 not installed" warning on startup | Run `pip install boto3` in the same Python environment as ComfyUI. |
| "Cloudflare R2 requires either ..." | Set `COMFY_S3_ACCOUNT_ID` (your R2 account ID), or set `COMFY_S3_ENDPOINT_URL` to a fully-formed R2 endpoint. |
| "Custom provider requires COMFY_S3_ENDPOINT_URL" | The `Custom` provider has no preset; you must supply an `endpoint_url` (env var, profile, or directly). |
| "Unknown cloud storage provider" | Provider name is case-sensitive. Must be one of the values listed in the Supported Providers table. |

## Contributing

- Branching: `main` + feature branches
- Tests: `python -m pytest tests/ -v` -- all tests must pass
- PR checklist:
  - [ ] Tests added or updated
  - [ ] New nodes registered in `__init__.py`

## Security

- **Credentials are never stored in workflow JSON.** The Cloud Storage Profile node only stores the profile name as a widget value. Actual keys are resolved server-side from environment variables or the profiles.json file.
- **profiles.json is HTTP-inaccessible.** It lives in ComfyUI's `user/__cloud_storage/` directory, which uses the `__` system prefix convention that blocks HTTP endpoint access.
- **Never commit profiles.json or `.env` files.** Use a secret manager or environment variables in production.
- To report security issues, open a GitHub issue or contact the maintainers directly.
